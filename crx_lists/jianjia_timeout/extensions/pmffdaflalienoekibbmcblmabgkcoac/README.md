# BitBucket NBviewer #

Commiting IPython/Jupyter notebooks is great - but since they are just JSON, looking at a commit diff is often unhelpful. This Chrome extension adds a button in BitBucket to NBviewer, which then reads the raw commit, and renders it.

Obviously this will only work for public repos.

## An example ##
This repo: https://bitbucket.org/underworldproject/underworld2/src/255efa34f7ee/InputFiles/?at=default

gives a nice range of IPython notebooks to test this extension with!
